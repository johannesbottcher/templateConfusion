Deedy resume/cv

I took the time to search for the quite popular (measured by the
number of support questions floating around)
deedy-resume-template. The git repo lists two versions alone, one
to use Mac-fonts, one with free fonts. Overleaf and
Latextemplates also have a version. Sharelatex has two versions,
one with the openfonts as found on the git-repo, one with *other*
open free fonts to substitute the Mac fonts (namely TeX Gyre
Heros and Lato). Overleaf, also has another version of the
template, which does have only one column instead of two.

All class files differ, more or less, even with the same
date set in `ProvidesClass`.  
The template versions (the class file does have a date, but no
version note) are different, the tex files will differ anyway.

A user looking for a template will see the online services first,
the original repo last (at least i guess). Doing support, we get
a *I use deedy template question* and have 5 possible starting
points. Asking the user questions just to know with which
specific template to work on will be annoying for both sides.

Are those 5 different projects forks of one major project,
different branches if you like? Since they are used standalone,
shouldn't they have a specific name? 

Any thoughts of the template providers concerning this *issue*? Is this
an issue after all? What do other helpers think?

PS: The git repo has 168 forks. Update 2016-10-09: 278 forks
