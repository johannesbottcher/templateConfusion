Deedy resume/cv

I took the time to search for the quite popular (measured by the
number of support question floating around)
deedy-resume-template. The git repo lists two versions alone, one
to use Mac-fonts, one with free fonts. Overleaf and
Latextemplates also have a version. Sharelatex has two versions,
one with the openfonts as found on the git-repo, one with *other*
open free fonts to substitute the Mac fonts (namely TeX Gyre
Heros and Lato),


git-repo      v.1.2 2014-09-16 
overleaf      v.1.1 2014-04-30 (openfonts)
sharelatex    v.1.1 2014-04-30 (openfonts)
sharelatexMod v.1.0 2014-04-30 (TeX Gyre fonts)
vel           v.1.0 2014-05-05 (macfonts}


All tex and class files differ, more or less, even with the same
date set in `ProvidesClass`. 

A user looking for a template will see the online services first,
the original repo last (at least i guess). Doing support, we get
a *I use deedy template question* and have 5 possible starting
points. Asking the user questions just to know with which
specific template to work on will be annoying for both sides.


PS: The git repo has 168 forks.
