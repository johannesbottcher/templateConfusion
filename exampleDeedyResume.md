Deedy resume/cv

I took the time to search for the quite popular (measured by the
number of support question floating around)
deedy-resume-template. The git repo lists two versions alone, one
to use Mac-fonts, one with free fonts. Overleaf and
Latextemplates also have a version. Sharelatex has two versions,
one with the openfonts as found on the git-repo, one with *other*
open free fonts to substitute the Mac fonts (namely TeX Gyre
Heros and Lato),

All class files differ, more or less, even with the same
date set in `ProvidesClass`.  
The template versions (the class file does have a date, but no
version note) are different, the tex files will differ anyway.

A user looking for a template will see the online services first,
the original repo last (at least i guess). Doing support, we get
a *I use deedy template question* and have 5 possible starting
points. Asking the user questions just to know with which
specific template to work on will be annoying for both sides.

Are those 5 different projects forks of one major project,
different branches if you like? Since they are used standalone,
shouldn't they have a specific name? 

Any thoughts of the template providers concerning this *issue*? Is this
an issue after all? What do other helpers think?

PS: The git repo has 168 forks.
